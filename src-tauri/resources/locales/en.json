  "faq.data_storage.question": "What data is stored where?",
  "faq.encryption.answer": "Vauchi uses multiple layers of encryption:\n\n**End-to-end encryption:**\nYour data is encrypted on your device before it leaves. Only you and your intended recipients can read it.\n\n**Double Ratchet protocol:**\nEach message uses a unique key. Even if one key is compromised, other messages remain secure.\n\n**Local storage encryption:**\nData on your device is encrypted with your device key.\n\nWe use the same cryptographic standards as Signal.",
  "faq.encryption.question": "How is my data protected?",
  "faq.first_contact.answer": "To add a contact, you need to meet in person:\n\n1. Tap the Exchange tab\n2. Show your QR code to the other person\n3. They scan it with their Vauchi app\n4.

  "faq.first_contact.question": "How do I add my first contact?",
  "faq.how_updates_work.answer": "When you edit your card:\n\n1. The change is encrypted on your device\n2. Sent to the relay server (still encrypted)\n3. Delivered to your contacts' devices\n4. Decrypted only on their devices\n\nUpdates are typically delivered within seconds. If a contact is offline, updates wait on the relay and are delivered when they reconnect.",
  "faq.how_updates_work.question": "How do updates reach my contacts?",
  "faq.multiple_devices.answer": "Yes! Link your devices in Settings:\n\n1. On your new device, install Vauchi\n2. Choose 'Link to Existing Account'\n3. On your original device, go to Settings > Devices > Link Device\n4. Scan the QR code on your new device\n\nYour contacts, cards, and settings will sync across devices.",
  "faq.multiple_devices.question": "Can I use Vauchi on multiple devices?",
  "faq.offline_updates.answer": "Vauchi handles offline gracefully:\n\n**When you go offline:**\n- Your edits are saved locally\n- They'll be sent when you reconnect\n\n**When contacts are offline:**\n- Updates queue on the relay\n- Delivered when they reconnect\n- No data loss\n\nThe relay stores encrypted messages for up to 30 days.",

  "faq.phone_lost.answer": "Your identity can be recovered through Social Recovery. If you've set up recovery contacts, meet 3 or more of them in person. They can vouch for you, and your identity will be restored.\n\nTo set up recovery: Go to Settings > Recovery > Add Recovery Contacts.",

  "faq.recovery_setup.answer": "Recovery contacts are people who can vouch for your identity if you lose access:\n\n1. Go to Settings > Recovery\n2. Tap 'Add Recovery Contact'\n3. Meet your trusted contact in person\n4. They'll scan your QR code to become a recovery contact\n\nWe recommend adding 5-7 people you trust and see regularly.",
  "faq.recovery_setup.question": "How do I set up recovery contacts?",
  "faq.remove_contact.answer": "To remove a contact:\n\n1. Go to your Contacts list\n2. Tap on the contact\n3. Tap the menu (three dots)\n4. Select 'Remove Contact'\n\nNote: They will still have your card, but won't receive your future updates. Consider asking them to remove you too.",
  "faq.remove_contact.question": "How do I remove a contact?",
  "faq.tracking.answer": "No. Vauchi is designed with privacy first:\n\n- No location data is ever collected or shared\n- Your card contains only what you choose to add\n- All data is end-to-end encrypted\n- The relay server can't read your content\n- We have no analytics or tracking\n\nYour contacts only see the fields you've shared with them.",

  "faq.visibility_default.question": "What's the default visibility?",
  "faq.visibility_labels.answer": "Visibility labels let you control who sees what:\n\n1. Create labels like 'Family', 'Work', 'Friends'\n2. Assign contacts to labels\n3. Mark fields as visible to specific labels\n\nExample: Your home address shows to 'Family' but not 'Work'.\n\nTo set up: Go to your card > tap a field > Set Visibility.",
  "faq.visibility_labels.question": "What are visibility labels?",
  "faq.why_in_person.answer": "The in-person QR exchange is a core privacy feature:\n\n- **No spam**: You can't be added by strangers\n- **Verified identity**: You know who you're connecting with\n- **No social graph**: We can't see who you know\n- **Physical trust**: Cryptographic trust starts with physical presence\n\nThis is similar to how Signal verifies contacts in person.",
